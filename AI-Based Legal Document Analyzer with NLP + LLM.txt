I can provide a conceptual code structure and key snippets that demonstrate how you would integrate the mentioned technologies (Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, SpaCy, OpenAI APIs) to achieve the functionalities you described.

This example will focus on a common legal tech use case: Extracting specific clauses and summarizing a legal document.

Prerequisites:

You'll need to install the necessary libraries. For OpenAI, remember to set your API key as an environment variable.

Bash

pip install transformers spacy langchain openai python-dotenv
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# --- 1. Document Loading and Preprocessing (SpaCy & Basic Python) ---
# In a real application, you'd handle PDF, DOCX, etc., conversion to text.
# Libraries like PyPDF2, python-docx, or unicommon (for broader formats) would be used.

    and potentially custom NER.
